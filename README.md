Predicting Residential Ad-Valorem Taxes in Boston
“Assessing”
“Our mission is to accurately assess property and provide prompt and courteous help to the public. We determine the value of property in Boston for the purpose of taxation.”

“In Massachusetts, the estimated value of a property is called an assessment. The property tax is based on the value of the property. This is sometimes called “ad valorem,” a Latin term that means ‘to the value.’”

The purpose of this study is to determine if we can produce a prediction of what the assessed taxes should be based on a number of different predictor variables (input variables). The city of Boston has 22 wards. It will be interesting to see if the same predictor variables show up in all the wards and if we get the same equation in each ward. You will use R, JMP and SAS to do your analyses.
